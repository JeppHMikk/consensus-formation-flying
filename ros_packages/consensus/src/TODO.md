# TODO

* Implement constraint steps
* Add cylindrical obstacle
* Implement joy reader
* Implement APF obstacle avoidance w. known obstacle position and radius.
* Test w. four drones and manual control
    * Expected outcome: The drones will avoid the obstacle and remain in formation by changing rotation, scale, and translation.
